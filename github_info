# How to push the code

Create new dir:
mkdir referme

Enter in referme/
cd referme

Initialize git directory
git init

Get code from github directory
git clone https://github.com/aimhigh692/referme.git

To always check status of the code
git status

ALWAYS EDIT IN NEW BRANCH AND NEVER ON MASTER
Create New branch to edit the code, Master is the main branch and we push the code to master only when we are sure in later stages.
git checkout -b <branch_name for eg: edit_info>

To add changes:
git add github_info 

To list all the branch
git branch

Commit all the changes in local machine:
git commit -m "Second commit"

Push change to remote repository for other to start editing/viewing
git push origin edit_info

To sync code from github
git pull https://github.com/aimhigh692/referme.git <branch_name>
