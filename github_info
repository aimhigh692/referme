# How to push the code

Create new dir:
mkdir referme

Enter in referme/
cd referme

Initialize git directory
git init

Get code from github directory
git clone https://github.com/aimhigh692/referme.git

To always check status of the code
git status

To add changes:
git add github_info 

Create New branch to edit the code, Master is the main branch and we push the code to master only when we are sure in later stages.
git checkout -b edit_info

To list all the branch
git branch

Commit all the changes in local machine:
git commit -m "Second commit"

Push change to remote repository for other to start editing/viewing
git push origin edit_info
